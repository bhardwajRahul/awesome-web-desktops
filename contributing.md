# Contribution Guidelines

* The website suggested must have a design which look like a typical desktop computer GUI, ideally something like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface#Examples).
* Please add your link to the **bottom** of the list as I'd like to keep a chronological order for the additions.
* Please do not add websites that are hidden behind logins (without available credentials), or paywalls.
* Please add only fully developed websites or apps that are in working condition. Projects that are in an early stage or broken will not be accepted.
